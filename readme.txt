This app lets people study Mandarin Chinese vocabulary in a cohesive incremental way.


The majority of mandarin words are composed of two characters. 

Let C be the set of characters in use in standard Mandarin and W be the set of ordered character-tuples of which form words. The tuple (C, W) forms a directed graph. 

Learning mandarin vocabulary can be thought of as starting with initially empty sets c and w of known characters and words respectively and slowly populating them. 

This app assists the user in doing this by presenting characters to be added to c in order of usage frequency from most common to least common.  Each character, x, to be added to c is is presented together with all words, (x,i) and (j,x), where i and j are in cU{x}. The user  

At the end of this process c==C and w==W

Main areas of focus in learning Standard Mandarin Chinese(SMC) are

	1) The phonetic system of SMC
	2) Grammar
	3) The writing system
	4) vocabulary

Each of these can be future subdivided into sub-skills which can be either passive or productive. 




1) The Phonetic System of SMC

	SKILLS
	1.1 - auditory syllable recognition
	1.2 - verbal syllable production
	1.3 - pinyin


---description---
Sounds in SMC can be dived into syllables. Syllables are defined by the values of three parts: a starting component called an initial, an ending component called a final, and the overall tone. 

There are 
	- 22 possible initials
	- 39 finals
	- 4 tones 

Not all combinations of initials and finales are realized or possible in SMC.

Pinyin is the romanization system for SMC used widely in main land China and around the world. Each syllable in SMC can be phonetically written using latin letters in the Pinyin system. The name 'Pinyin' is itself the Pinyin romanization of the system's name in SMC.

2) Gramar

	SKILLS
	2.1 - productive skills
	2.2 - passive skills

---description---
The grammar of SMC is simple, often follows sentence templates with interchangeable parts, has no grammatical gender, number, verb conjugation, or verb tense. 

There are also several common features not largely present in Indo-European languages which pose learning challenges.

3) The writing system

	SKILLS
	3.1 - knowledge of the radical system
		3.1.1 - ability to recognize all forms of all radicles
		3.1.2 - ability to write all forms of all radicles
	3.2 - vocabulary of SMC characters
		3.2.1 - recognition of SMC characters
			3.2.1.1 - knowledge of possible pronunciation 
			3.2.1.2 - knowledge of meaning 
		3.2.2 - production of SMC characters
			3.2.2.1 - ability to hand write a character from scratch
			3.2.2.2 - ability to type characters

---description---
The writing system of SMC consists a set of around 3000 commonly used logographic characters. 

Each character is built out of smaller meaning baring pieces called radicles. There are 214 radicles. The exact way radicals fit together and are organized to produce a character is unique to each character although there are several common schemas which are typically followed.

Each character phonetically represents a single spoken syllable. 

Some characters represent different syllables in different contexts.

Knowing how to write and read characters demands the intermediate skill of full knowledge of the radical system.

4) vocabulary

	SKILLS
	4.1 word recognitin 
		4.1.1 knowledge of meaning and grammatical attributes
	4.2 word production

---description---
Words in SMC have well defined meanings and grammatical attributes. 

Although a word may be composed of any number of characters, the vast majority of words are composed of two characters with a smaller set of common words being composed of one. 
Knowing how to write and read characters demands the intermediate skill of full knowledge of the radical system.
